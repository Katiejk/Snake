This app was created for an assignment in spring 2020. It was built with tablets in mind.

To play the game, use the arrow buttons to change direction. Eat food to get points- but be careful not to crash into the walls!

Game features 5 navigation fragments, MVVM implementation, SafeArgs, 7 sound effects, and lots of different animations. There are only image buttons except for the debugger Game Over button. There are two radio button groups, both in settings.

Have fun!
